    "about": "I am logical and creative and love learning!  I am a full-stack software engineer with a lifetime practice in being curious. Software Engineering has opened up a whole new way of solving problems and serving people.  The skills and passions that made me a exuberant and highly effect teacher and problem solver across 9 years of working as STEAM instructor for middle-school age kids are now driving and empowering me to design and create in a way that seeks to serve people and understand their needs in using applications. While I am full-stack capable and find backend relaxing, my user oriented thinking and love for design gives me a special edge in frontend development.",
    "bio1": "I am a perpetually curious person.  My favorite question is 'why', followed closely by 'what if'. I love the creative process, and find that environments where I can work with a team to brainstorm a cool concept, collaborate and problem solve to come up with a plan, then work together to make that dream come to life are some of the most rewarding life moments.  For this reason, the work that I have sought for myself in life centers around fast-paced, people oriented work groups that require problem solving and solutions oriented thinking.",  
    "bio2":"As a software engineer, I am starting with a rich perspective informed by a successful and meaningful first career and deeply meaningful personal experiences that make me skilled and well-rounded. I am driven to bring the best version of myself to the work that I do both professionally and personally. I seek to be current in my knowledge and appreciate being surrounded with people who think differently than me.  This perspective difference helps ensure that I am ever growing, and the work that we do has the perspective of differing views and opinions.",
    "bio3": "Stagnation is something that dulls life for me.  I enjoy work that is challenging and requires me to push myself to learn and grow.  I  understand that my best work comes when I am living in a balanced way that respects and upholds my values and principles. Having a growth mindset in life has led me to know and understand myself, and live in a way that seeks to be mentally, physically, and socially well.  This allows me the self-awareness to make decisions that empower me to work and give from the surplus of a life well-lived.  Living this way has brought happiness and success to my life and those around me. ",
    "location": "I grew up in rural middle Tennessee, and now live the in beautiful city of Chattanooga, known to many as Gig City with some of the fastest internet in the USA.  Chattanooga's local vibe of modern yet smalltown classy with a splash of culture and outdoor adventure is a big part of why I chose to settle here.",
    "interests": "Wonder is a feeling I experience a lot. Beign curious has led me to enjoy a wide variety of activites.  I enjoy outdoorsie things like hiking, camping kayaking/paddle boarding, and camping, as well as sports like ultimate frisbee, racquetball, spikeball and pickball.  I also enjoy more indoor things like playing video games, table top gaming with my squad, doing artwork, playing piano and coming up with culinary creations.   I love stories, and seek movies and books that explore the human experience in new and creative ways, especially as portrayed in sci-fi and fantasy based worlds.",
