    "bio": "It me, I did it.  I switched from being a masters level teacher, to being a damn good massage therapist, and now, I'm finding so much satisfaction in honing my skills as a software engineer.  I graduated from General Assembly in 2017. Afterwords, I will go on to work for companies that align with my mission mindedness; mental health, education, humanitarian organizations. I also recently started exploring React Native, because mobile apps are were it's at!"
